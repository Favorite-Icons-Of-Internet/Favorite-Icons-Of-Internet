# Favorite Icons Of Internet

Art project that aims to depict the vastness and colorfullness of the internet.

You can see the result of all the crawling and image-crunching at [FavoriteIconsOfInternet.com](http://www.favoriteiconsofinternet.com/)

Our current goal is to bring the project to the state where we can keep the history of daily favicon changes for at least a million web sites.
